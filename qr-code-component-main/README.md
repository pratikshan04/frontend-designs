## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using flex to create cards sections in column view 

```css
.card-wrapper {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- Get comfortable to use flex
- Write better optimized syles

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) - This is CSS Flexible box layout documentation.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for learning flex. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
